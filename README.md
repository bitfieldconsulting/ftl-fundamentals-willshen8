Welcome to these exercises in the fundamentals of Go!

Start at exercise [01](01/README.md), and go on from there.

I suggest that when you've completed the first exercise that requires you to make code changes, you commit those changes in Git, and push your repo.

If you are working through these exercises as a GitHub Classroom assignment, that will enable the mentor to review your code right away. You don't need to wait until you've finished all the exercises before submitting your changes.

On with the fun!
